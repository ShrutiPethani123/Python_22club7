1. Make one function that print all perfect number between that range.

2. find nth term of arithmetic progression.

a,d,n

first term = a
difference = d

a=3
d=2

ap: 3 5 7 9 11

nth term = a + (n-1)d

2nd = 3+1(2) = 5

3. Make one function that print all armstrong number between that range.

4. input: {name:[lamya,nihar,khush] , marks:[10,20,30]}
o/p: [{'name':'lamya', 'marks':10}, {'name':'nihar', 'marks':20} ,{'name':'khush', 'marks':30}]
